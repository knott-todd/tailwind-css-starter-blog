Firstly, Merry Christmas!

Let's get the obvious out of the way: you meet ambitious, intelligent people, from across the world, with wildly varying perspectives. I feel challenged, and competitive, yet right at home.

### So what?

What does it really mean, concretely, and what is the value of a broader world view? And what can I leave you with if you don't get the opportunity to study abroad?

### 1\. The combination of meeting people who want to do big things (or have already started), and the access to resources of all kinds (from mentorship, to supplies, and financing) I believe, encourages me to do bigger things.

I have access to 3D printers that are free to use so long as you provide filament, aisles of music rooms each with it's own piano, professors who are experts in a wide variety of fields and work with cutting edge equipment, and the all-mighty gold mine that is online shopping (AliExpress and Amazon). These things aren't impossible to find in Trinidad, and heck, may even be available within UWI—our local university. But I never had access like this before, or felt so capable.

Then there's the people. The high demand and idolization of western tertiary education naturally filters international students who either (for the most part) are incredibly driven and smart enough to get a scholarship, or have the monetary means. The former pushes you. I've been challenged on my political views, or rather, lack of awareness at the time, and have since grown to research, appreciate the importance of, and become concerned with global politics. I have teamed up with similarly ambitious people who want to build something—winning a Start Up pitch competition, and continuing on to develop a start up together. Idioms are idioms for a reason, they're true. And you are a product of your environment.

Thus, with a combination of access and an environment of driven intellectuals, you feel encouraged to just do **something**.

Visiting back home, I feel trapped. I know I can find the equipment I need if I really wanted to. I could still order the parts I need, albeit at a bit higher cost and wait time. But I do also think that it's only because I'm here for a short while. If I moved back, and was here for an extended period, now knowing the possibilities, I'd likely find a way to continue create in the way I do now. That's an idea for anyone wanting to start a business: make prototyping more accessible and discoverable in Trinidad. And, make our public transportation run like clockwork. And, open 24/7 fast food delivery across the country.

### 2\. Holy crap the world is actually so big and so different.

I don't think any blog, TV show, or YouTube video can really internalize for you what it means to experience culture and life in a different country, but I'll try my best. It's different, yet the same. It's the same in that for the most part, all of the types of people you meet, the personalities, exist pretty much everywhere else. You have kind people, you have arrogant people, you have racists, and you have saints. No entire country—the people, that is—is more kind, or more evil. Maybe reskinned, with different accents and looks, but it seems no matter where you go people don't change. Now, what's different? There's the obvious things like weather, terrain, ethnicities, etc. But the most impactful thing for me is what I believe locals don't even notice, or perhaps take for granted. The efficiency and ease of infrastructure and systems in Toronto are what really stood out to me; notably, the subway and bus system throughout the city. How quick it is to get an Uber in the dead middle of night, or Uber Eats at 2am because everything nearby is closed. It also brought to light the things I take for granted back home: the warmness of people, and oh my gosh, mountains! water! trees! SUN!

I think having grown up with international content from TV to YouTube, it's easy to get desensitized to the fact that these places and people are real, and tangible. Like your friends, and your parents, they physically walk, and talk, and you can, in fact, shake their hands, or see them in a concert, existing outside of the flat 2D screens we experience them on.

What should you take away from this? If you ever do get the opportunity to travel abroad, or maybe in the future, send your child abroad, and are on the fence about it, do it. Better yet, if you can live there for an extended period. Nothing, no amount of research, reading, or videos, will allow you to fully appreciate what it means to experience another country, especially one so different to your own.
